# CRUD APIs for Simple Todo Application

This project was created to create simple CRUD opertions with data being stored on API locally. The APIs are written in Nodejs.

## Install Dependencies and Running application lopcally

First install dependencies using either npm or yarn. I recommend using yarn because of the speed of installation.

```sh
$ npm install
```

or

```sh
$ yarn
```

Then to start the server just run

```sh
$ npm run start
```

or

```sh
$ yarn start
```
